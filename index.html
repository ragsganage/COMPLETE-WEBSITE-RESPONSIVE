    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits 
    and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework,
    such as public schools. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system, 
    while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, 
    including early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on teaching methods, 
    such as teacher-centered and student-centered education, and on subjects, such as science education, language education, and physical education. Additionally,
    the term "education" can denote the mental states and qualities of educated individuals and the academic field studying educational phenomena.</p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The precise definition of education is disputed, and there are disagreements about 
    the aims of education and the extent to which education differs from indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. 
    These disagreements impact how to identify, measure, and enhance various forms of education. Essentially, 
    education socializes children into society by instilling cultural values and norms, equipping them with the
    skills necessary to become productive members of society. In doing so, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. 
    Organized institutions play a significant role in education. </p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Many factors influence the success of education. 
    Psychological factors include motivation, intelligence, and personality. Social factors,
    such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender, are often associated with discrimination. 
    Other factors encompass access to educational technology, teacher quality, and parental involvement.
    The primary academic field examining education is known as education studies. 
    It delves into the nature of education, its objectives, impacts, and methods for enhancement. 
    Education studies encompasses various subfields, including philosophy, psychology, sociology, and economics of education. 
    Additionally, it explores topics such as comparative education, pedagogy, and the history of education.
    In prehistory, education primarily occurred informally through oral communication and imitation.
